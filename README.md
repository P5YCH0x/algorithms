<h2 align="center"> Binary Tree</h2>
<p>starts at the first item in list and builds the tree by adding each element that comes after as 'nodes' to left or right depending on whether they are bigger or smaller.</p>
<p>when searching through the list if the number is bigger all nodes on the left can be ignored and if smaller all on the right are ignored</p>
<p>This should cut the number of items that need to be looked through in half each time a node is checked</p>
