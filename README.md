<h2 align="center"> Binary Tree</h2>
<p>Starts at the first item in list and builds the tree by adding each element that comes after as 'nodes' to left or right depending on whether they are bigger or smaller.</p>
<p>When searching through the list if the number is bigger all nodes on the left can be ignored and if smaller all on the right are ignored.</p>
<p>This should cut the number of items that need to be looked through in half each time a node is checked.</p>

<h2 align="center"> Peak Finder</h2>
<p>tries to find a peak.</p>
<p>An item is a peak if it is the bigger than the number on it's left and right.</p>

<h2 align="center"> Largest Area</h2>
<p>Each point is 1 space apart with variable heights.</p>
<p>The goal is to find the maximum area that can be filled with water.</p>

<h2 align="center"> Quick Sort</h2>
<p>A fast sorting algorithm</p>
<p>Uses divide and conquer approach where it chooses a number from the array and then splits the array into 2, an array of numbers smaller than the chosen number and an array of bigger numbers.</p>
<p>The function is then called again by the smaller and bigger arrays until all numbers are in place.</p>
